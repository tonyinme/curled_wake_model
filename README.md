# 🌪️ Curled Wake Model

A fast, modular, and extensible Python solver for wind farm flows using the **Curled Wake Model (CWM)**, based on the method introduced by [Martínez-Tossas et al. (2021)](https://wes.copernicus.org/articles/6/555/2021/). This tool enables rapid simulation and analysis of wind turbine wake interactions in atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flows.

Install dependencies via conda and pip:

```bash
# 1. Create a conda environment with Python >= 3.12
conda create -n cwm_env python=3.12

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate cwm_env

# 3. Clone the rk4_solvers branch of the repository
git clone https://github.com/tonyinme/curled_wake_model.git
cd curled_wake_model

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install -e .
```

If using Windows this can be done using Powershell
```bash
:: 1. Make sure Python 3.12 or newer is installed
::    You can check with:
python --version

:: 2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv cwm_env

:: 3. Activate the virtual environment
cwm_env\Scripts\activate

:: 4. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tonyinme/curled_wake_model.git
cd curled_wake_model

:: 5. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

:: 6. Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

You may also want to install:

- `matplotlib`
